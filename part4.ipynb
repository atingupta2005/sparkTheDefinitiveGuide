    "-  DFs vs RDDs:\n",
    "    -  recommended to use Scala/Java for RDDs\n",
    "    -  Python expensively serializes data to and from Python process when running RDD code\n",
    "-  RDD Object Serialization:\n",
    "    -  set _spark.serializer_ to _org.apache.spark.serializer.KryoSerializer_\n",
    "-  Dynamic Allocation:\n",
    "    -  dynamically allocate resources\n",
    "    -  set _spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled_ to _true_\n",
    "-  Scheduling:\n",
    "    -  set _spark.scheduler.mode_ to _FAIR_\n",
    "    -  FAIR provides better sharing of resources across multiple users\n",
    "    -  set --max-executor-cores to specify max # of executor cores application will need\n",
    "    -  --max-executor-cores ensures application won't consume up all the resources on cluster\n",
    "-  Data Storage Format:\n",
    "    -  favor structured binary type for frequent access\n",
    "    -  Apache Parquet is best\n",
    "-  Splittable File Types / Compression:\n",
    "    -  \"splittable\" => different tasks can read different parts of the file in parallel\n",
    "    -  use compression like gzip, snappy\n",
    "    -  **try to keep individual read files no larger than a few hundred MB for \"splittable\" purpose**\n",
    "-  Table Partitioning:\n",
    "    -  stores files in separate directories based on a key (column)\n",
    "    -  improves speed, filtering, and spread of data across cluster\n",
    "-  Bucketing:\n",
    "    -  allows Spark to \"pre-partition\" data according to how joins or aggregations are performed\n",
    "    -  helps with partitioning / prevent shuffle before join / data access speed\n",
    "-  Number of Files:\n",
    "    -  avoid many small files and many large files\n",
    "    -  **rule of thumb is to aim for each written file to be around a few tens of MB**\n",
    "    -  _maxRecordsPerFile_ => controls how many records go into each file\n",
    "-  Data Locality:\n",
    "    -  specifies a preference for certain nodes that hold certain data\n",
    "    -  avoids exchanging blocks of data over the network\n",
    "    -  local storage (ex: HDFS) marked as \"local\" in Spark UI tasks\n",
    "-  Table Statistics:\n",
    "    -  table level stats => ANALYZE TABLE tableName COMPUTE STATISTICS\n",
    "    -  column level stats => ANALYZE TABLE tableName COMPUTE STATISTICS FOR COLUMNS column1, column2, etc.\n",
    "-  Shuffle Configurations (Spark's External Shuffle Servce):\n",
    "    -  helps increase performance because nodes read shuffle data from remote machines even when executors on machines are busy\n",
    "    -  small partitions lead to some nodes being under-utilized and data skews\n",
    "    -  large partitions lead to overhead and some nodes dominating\n",
    "    -  **aim for around a few tens of MB of data per output partition in shuffle**\n",

    "    -  gather statistics via _spark.executor.extraJavaOptions_ => -verbose:gc -XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps\n",
    "    -  logs located on cluster's worker nodes (in stdout files)\n",
    "-  Parallelism:\n",
    "    -  increase parallelism to speed up stage\n",
    "    -  recommendations:\n",
    "        -  use 2 or 3 tasks per CPU cores in cluster if stage processes large amount of data:\n",
    "            -  set _spark.default.parallelism_\n",
    "            -  set _spark.sql.shuffle.partitions_ => number of cores in cluster\n",
    "-  Filtering:\n",
    "    -  always filter has early on as possible\n",
    "-  Repartitioning / Coalescing:\n",
    "    -  repartition:\n",
    "        -  incurs a shuffle\n",
    "        -  optimizes execution/parallelism by load balancing data across cluster\n",
    "        -  helpful for joins/cached data\n",
    "    -  coalesce:\n",
    "        -  reduces # of shuffles by merging partitions on nodes\n",

    "    -  reuse same dataset over and over\n",
    "    -  places DF, table, RDD into temporary storage (memory or disk) across executors in cluster\n",
